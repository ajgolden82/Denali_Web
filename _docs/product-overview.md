# Denali Web Overview

## ?
ArcBill is a cloud-based app that gives you end-to-end control of bill management, invoicing, customer payments, etc. Use our REST API to integrate ArcBill with your accounting software to streamline the billing and payment process.

The API lets you `Get` and `Post` GL Accounts, `Get` and `Post` Vendors, and `Get` and `Update` bills.

## Before you can use the API:
 1. Get a username and password from Archarina. (How does this work - is there a trial you can sign up for? Is there a contact email - there needs to be a way to test this out before purchasing)
 2. Use your username and password to get an access token.
